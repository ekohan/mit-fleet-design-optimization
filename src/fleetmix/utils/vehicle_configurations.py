    """Enumerate every feasible vehicleâ€“compartment configuration.

    For each vehicle *type* and for every non-empty subset of compartments, a
    new configuration is created.  The Cartesian product is represented using
    a binary vector where each element corresponds to whether a good can be
    carried in that configuration.

    Args:
        vehicle_types (dict): Mapping ``{vehicle_name: {'capacity': int,
            'fixed_cost': float}}``.
        goods (list[str]): Ordered list of product types (e.g., ``['Dry',
            'Chilled', 'Frozen']``).  The order must stay consistent across the
            entire codebase.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: One row per configuration with columns
        ``goods``, ``Vehicle_Type``, ``Config_ID``, ``Capacity``, ``Fixed_Cost``.

    Example:
        >>> vehicle_types = {'A': {'capacity': 3000, 'fixed_cost': 100}}
        >>> configs = generate_vehicle_configurations(vehicle_types, ['Dry', 'Frozen'])
